# Azure Active Diretory

This is a collection of Logic Apps for working with Active Directory configurations, mainly via REST APIs

For each JSON declared by the Logic App I have created a text explaining the purpose and extra parameterisation for each case.

My intention is to keep growing this list.

- [Block IPs on Conditional Access](BlockIPsCA.md) Add a new IP on every running to an existing Named Location on Conditional Access



Greetings.
