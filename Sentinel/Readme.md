# Azure Sentinel

These Logic Apps allow you to connect to Azure Sentinel to get or import data, unattended and automatically.

For each JSON declared by the Logic App I have created a text explaining the purpose and extra parameterisation for each case.

My intention is to keep growing this list.

## Index

- [Sentinel Config Backup](SentinelConfigBackup.md)
	- Azure Sentinel configuration backup to individual JSON files
- [User Access Administrator elevations AAD](UserAccessAdministratorAAD.md)
	- Send Activity Logs events for User Access Administration elevations to Sentinel
- [Monitoring for Azure Subscription Creation](SubscriptionCreation.md)
	- Allow monitoring for the creation of Azure subscriptions. Send the event to Sentinel and email advise
- [Newly Azure Resources created](NewAzResourcesCreated.md)
	- List of resources crated on your Azure subscriptions





Greetings.
