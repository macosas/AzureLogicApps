# Azure Sentinel

These Logic Apps allow you to connect to Azure Sentinel to get or import data, unattended and automatically.

For each JSON declared by the Logic App I have created a text explaining the purpose and extra parameterisation for each case.

My intention is to keep growing this list.

## Index

- [SentinelConfigBackup.json](SentinelConfigBackup.json)
	- Azure Sentinel configuration backup to individual JSON files
- [UserAccessAdministratorAAD.json](UserAccessAdministratorAAD.json)
	- Send Activity Logs events for User Access Administration elevations to Sentinel





Greetings.
